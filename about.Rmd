In 1990, I graduated from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) with an A.B. in Psychology. From there I went to [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://www.rpi.edu/), where I earned an M.S. in Industrial and Organizational Psycholopgy in 1992. For three years following my graduation from RPI, I worked at the [Stratton VA Medical Center](https://www.albany.va.gov/) on a research project to evaluate better modes of health care and social services coordination for older veterans with multiple health problems. When the project was completed, I returned to RPI and earned a Ph.D. in Decision Sciences and Engineering Systems with a focus in Statistics. Since July 2000, I have served in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu) at [Appalachian State University](http://appstate.edu).
